# OTHR_AUTOSARSS18
This repository stores the code and documentations for the AUTOSAR course in the summer semester 2018

## Goal
The goal of this project is to control a NXT Brick (Brick 2) from another NXT Brick (Brick 1).
Brick 1 gets the driving information from a joystick.
Also on brick 1 there is an ultrasonic sensor and two buttons.
The brick 2 gets the information via bluetooth from brick 1 and react to them by driving and blinking four LEDs.
